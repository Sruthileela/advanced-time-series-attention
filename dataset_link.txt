The dataset used in this project is synthetically generated to simulate real-world multivariate
time-series data with clear daily and weekly seasonality patterns.

A total of 1500+ observations are generated using sinusoidal functions combined with controlled
Gaussian noise to ensure sufficient size and realistic variability.

The dataset generation process is fully reproducible and implemented in generate_data.py.
