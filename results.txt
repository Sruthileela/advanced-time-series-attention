Explainability Analysis (SHAP)

SHAP analysis was performed to interpret the predictions of the Transformer-based
time series model. The results indicate that feature_1 has the strongest influence
on short-term predictions, reflecting its close relationship with the target variable.
Feature_2 primarily contributes to long-term seasonal patterns, capturing cyclical
behavior in the data. Feature_3 shows a smaller but consistent contribution, acting
as a stabilizing factor in model predictions.

These insights validate that the model learns meaningful temporal and feature-level
relationships rather than relying on random correlations, increasing trust and
interpretability of the forecasting system.
