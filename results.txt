The dataset used in this project is synthetically generated to ensure sufficient size and controlled temporal patterns.
A total of 1500 observations were created using sinusoidal functions to represent daily and weekly seasonality,
combined with Gaussian noise to simulate real-world variability.

This approach ensures compliance with dataset size requirements while allowing clear evaluation of the
Transformer model's ability to learn long-term dependencies in multivariate time-series data.
