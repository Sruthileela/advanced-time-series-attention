Results and Observations:

1. The LSTM with Attention model successfully captures temporal patterns
   in the time series data.

2. The Attention mechanism improves forecasting accuracy by focusing on
   important time steps rather than treating all past values equally.

3. RMSE and MAE metrics indicate improved performance compared to
   traditional LSTM models without attention.

4. The model demonstrates stable convergence with Early Stopping,
   preventing overfitting.

5. This approach is suitable for real-world forecasting applications
   such as stock prices, energy demand, and sales prediction.
