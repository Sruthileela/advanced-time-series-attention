SHAP Interpretability Analysis

SHAP values were analyzed at multiple time indices in the test set.
During peak demand periods (e.g., time index ≈ 1000), feature_1 showed
the strongest positive contribution, indicating its influence on short-term
forecast spikes.

Feature_2 contributed significantly during cyclical transitions,
capturing daily seasonality effects. Feature_3 influenced longer-term
weekly trends, while feature_4 showed minimal but stabilizing impact.

This confirms that the Transformer model learns meaningful temporal
and feature-driven patterns rather than relying on noise.
