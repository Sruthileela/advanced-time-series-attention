Model Evaluation Results

Model: LSTM with Attention
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Test Loss (MSE): 0.0321
Test MAE: 0.0184

Observation:
The attention mechanism helps the model focus on key timesteps, improving prediction accuracy.
This setup with dropout and proper train-test evaluation ensures a more robust model.
