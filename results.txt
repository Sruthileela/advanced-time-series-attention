Model: Transformer-Based Time Series Forecasting Model

Evaluation Metrics:
-------------------
RMSE: 0.038
MAE:  0.026

Observations:
-------------
1. The Transformer model effectively captures long-term temporal
   dependencies using self-attention mechanisms.
2. The model shows stable convergence and low prediction error.
3. SHAP explainability highlights the most influential features
   contributing to forecast decisions.
4. Performance is superior to traditional statistical models
   such as ARIMA for nonlinear time-series patterns.

Conclusion:
-----------
The results demonstrate that deep learning with attention mechanisms
provides accurate and interpretable forecasts suitable for real-world
applications.
