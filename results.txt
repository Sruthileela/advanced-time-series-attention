Model Evaluation Results

Model: LSTM with Attention
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Test Loss (MSE): 0.0321
Test MAE: 0.0184

Observation:
The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on important timesteps, 
improving prediction accuracy. Dropout and train-test evaluation ensure robust performance.
