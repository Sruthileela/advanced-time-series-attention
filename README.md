# Advanced Time Series Forecasting using LSTM with Attention

## Overview
This project implements a robust deep learning model for time series forecasting using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** enhanced with an **Attention mechanism**. The attention layer allows the model to focus on **important timesteps**, improving prediction accuracy and interpretability. The project is suitable for sequential data tasks like stock price prediction, weather forecasting, or sensor data analysis.

## Objectives
- Build a robust LSTM-based model for sequence prediction
- Integrate attention mechanism to highlight key timesteps
- Evaluate model performance using **MSE** and **MAE**
- Provide a reproducible and professional project structure

## Key Features
- **LSTM Architecture:** Captures temporal patterns in sequential data  
- **Attention Mechanism:** Highlights key timesteps for better predictions  
- **Dropout Layers:** Prevent overfitting and improve generalization  
- **Train-Test Split:** Ensures reliable model evaluation  

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures overall prediction error  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures average absolute error
