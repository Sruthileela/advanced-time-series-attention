# Advanced Time Series Forecasting using LSTM with Attention

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model for time series forecasting using LSTM with an Attention mechanism. The attention layer helps focus on important timesteps, improving prediction accuracy.

## Objectives
- Build LSTM-based sequence forecasting model
- Integrate attention mechanism for key timestep focus
- Evaluate performance using MSE and MAE
- Save trained model and training history
