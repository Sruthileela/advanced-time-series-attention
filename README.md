# Advanced Time Series Forecasting using LSTM with Attention

## Overview
This project implements a robust deep learning model for time series forecasting using LSTM with an Attention mechanism. The model captures temporal dependencies and identifies important timesteps, improving forecasting accuracy.

## Objectives
- Build an LSTM-based time series forecasting model
- Integrate attention mechanism for improved focus
- Evaluate model using MSE and MAE
- Save trained model and training history
